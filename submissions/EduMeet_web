## Project Title
EduMeet: Revolutionizing Virtual Meetings Globally

## Inspiration Behind the Project
With many organizations, especially educational institutions and startups, limited by the cost of subscription-based meeting software, EduMeet was created to address the need for a budget-friendly, feature-rich solution.
