### Project Title
**MedConnect - Blockchain-Powered Healthcare Accessibility**

### Project Description
MedConnect is a blockchain-driven platform designed to make quality healthcare accessible, especially to underprivileged communities. It combines the power of Web3 for secure crowdfunding, Appwrite for backend services, and AI for diagnostic assistance. MedConnect allows users to access a secure crowdfunding platform for verified medical needs, file healthcare grievances, and explore virtual hospital tours through immersive AR/VR. The platform also integrates AI-powered health risk analysis, making it a comprehensive solution for healthcare accessibility.
