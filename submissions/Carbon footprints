## Project Title

CARBON FOOTPRINT TRACKER

## Project Description    

<We built CARBON FOOTPRINT TRACKER, a tool designed to help users calculate and track their carbon footprint. Our app uses user data and activities to estimate their carbon footprint, providing actionable insights to reduce it. The tracker encourages environmentally conscious decisions by highlighting specific areas where users can make a difference.>

## Inspiration behind the Project 

<The inspiration for CodeCapture came from the urgent need to reduce individual carbon footprints. We believe in empowering people with the right data to help make environmentally conscious choices, which can ultimately contribute to the global effort of reducing carbon emissions. This project idea stemmed from a shared commitment to environmental sustainability and the importance of data-driven awareness.>
