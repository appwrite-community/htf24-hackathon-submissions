## Project Title
Event Planner

## Project Description    
Event Planner is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and delete events efficiently. It features a user-friendly interface where users can input event details such as the title, description, date, time, location, category, and priority. Events are displayed in a card-based format for easy interaction and management. The project integrates CopilotKit for enhanced productivity through AI-powered suggestions and automation. For secure data handling, it uses Appwrite's backend services. More importantly here users can shere the event details on any social media.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The inspiration behind **Event Planner** was the need for a simple yet powerful tool to help users organize events efficiently. Many event management tools are either too complex or lack essential features. This project aims to provide an intuitive experience for both tech-savvy and casual users while leveraging modern AI tools to make the experience more interactive.

## Tech Stack    
- **React**: For building the frontend.
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and handling APIs.
- **TailwindCSS**: To style the user interface.
- **Shadcn-UI**: To ensure consistency in UI components.
- **CopilotKit**: To enable AI-powered suggestions and automation for tasks like event creation.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Appwrite**: As a backend service for secure data management, including databases and authentication.

### Usage of Appwrite
- **Appwrite Databases**: I used Appwrite Databases to store event details such as title, description, date, time, location, category, and priority.
- **Appwrite Authentication**: Appwrite Authentication was implemented to ensure the create, update, or delete events.
- **Appwrite Storage**: Event images or related media could be stored using Appwrite Storage for future feature expansions.

## Anything Else You Want To Share With Us?
This project is built with scalability in mind, offering a clean interface with the potential to integrate more advanced features like calendar synchronization and notifications. We plan to continue iterating on this project by adding more event management tools and expanding the use of AI to make it even smarter.
