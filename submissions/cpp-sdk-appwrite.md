## Project Title
### Appwrite SDK for C++

## Project Description
Appwrite C++ SDK is the SDK designed to integrate Appwrite’s powerful backend capabilities into C++ applications. Built from scratch, this SDK allows C++ developers to leverage Appwrite’s comprehensive suite of tools, including database management, file storage, and real-time data processing, without the need for workarounds or external dependencies.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
Our main aim was to enable C++ developers to easily access Appwrite’s powerful backend services, which were previously unavailable in C++. While Appwrite provides SDKs for popular languages like Node.js, Python, Dart, etc, C++ support was missing. Offering C++ support expands Appwrite's reach, encouraging adoption across more development communities and enabling new possibilities in cross-platform and native C++ applications.

## Tech Stack    
- C++ Programming Language
- Appwrite REST APIs
- Postman for API-Testing

## Usage of Appwrite
- **Appwrite Authenticaton** - Communication with Appwrite Authentication Services (Creating Account & Sessions)
- **Databases** - Integrated REST APIs to create update & delete databases, collections, attributes, documents & indexes. 
- **Bucket** - Also integrated the same for creating Bucket and listing files, etc
- **Health** - REST APIs Health Status of Appwrite Account.

## Anything Else You Want To Share With Us?
This C++ SDK for Appwrite is still in its early prototype stage, and we are incredibly excited to keep building and expanding its features. We're actively working to bring full Appwrite support to C++, from advanced database handling to enhanced authentication and storage functionalities.
