## Project Title
ShortFolio


## Project Description    
Shortfolio is a web application that helps engineers and developers create their portfolio in less than 2 minutes by creating their profile and providing them a portfolio template and personalised url which they can use as their portfolio website.


## Inspiration behind the Project  
 - As engineers and developers, we either don't get time to create a personal portfolio website for ourselves or we don't have a good design sense of creating one. 
 - This is what I have seen atleast around my network, very less people have their portfolio and their reasons were the same that I mentioned above. 
 - To solve this issue, I created this web application that lets the user enter their detail, and in return we provide them a good-looking and interactive portfolio page with a personalised url which they can use everywhere on the internet.


## Tech Stack    
Frontend Technologies Used - Next.js, TypeScript, React Hook Form, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN 
Backend, Database, User Authentication, and Storage - Appwrite 


### Usage of Appwrite
 - I have used Appwrite Databases to store the details of every user in the backend.
 - Used Appwrite Auth Service to register and login user, also used to find the active session details of the user.
 - Used Appwrite Storage for storing user images in the database.

## Anything Else You Want To Share With Us?
Being a person who is more interested and inclined towards Frontend development. Appwrite helped me a lot in creating this project as I could focus more on user interface and user experience while writing very minimal backend code.
