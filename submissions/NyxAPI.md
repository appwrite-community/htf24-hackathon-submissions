## Project Title

#NyxAPI

## Project Description    
NyxAPI is a tool that helps developers quickly create mock APIs, so front-end and back-end teams can work independently and stay productive even when certain parts of the project are still being developed. With NyxAPI, front-end developers can start building and testing features right away, even before the back-end is ready. This reduces delays and dependency on other team members, making it easier to keep the project moving forward.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The inspiration for NyxAPI came during my experience at Smart India Hackathon (SIH). I was part of a project where our frontend team faced significant roadblocks because the backend development wasn't ready yet. This created a bottleneck that slowed our progress; we couldn’t start testing or refining our UI and functionality without those APIs in place. When the backend was finally ready, we had very limited time left to integrate everything and iron out any issues.

This experience highlighted how crucial it is for front-end and back-end teams to be able to work independently. With NyxAPI, I aimed to create a tool that enables frontend developers to start building and testing their interfaces right from the start, without waiting on the backend. NyxAPI empowers teams to stay agile, ensuring that projects keep moving forward smoothly regardless of dependencies.

## Tech Stack for NyxAPI

NyxAPI was built with a robust and modern tech stack, designed for scalability, performance, and ease of use. Here’s a breakdown of the technologies and tools used to bring NyxAPI to life:

- **Frontend**: Built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, the frontend provides a responsive and interactive user interface. React’s component-based architecture allows us to efficiently manage state and UI, while Tailwind CSS makes designing flexible and highly customizable.

- **Backend**: The backend is powered by **Python** with **SQLAlchemy** as the ORM (Object Relational Mapper), making database management efficient and code more readable. SQLAlchemy’s flexibility allows us to easily connect with our **PostgreSQL** database, which serves as the primary data store, offering reliable and scalable data management.

- **Database**: **PostgreSQL** was chosen for its performance and robust data integrity. Its ACID-compliance and ability to handle complex queries make it a great fit for handling the mock data generated by NyxAPI.

- **Deployment**: NyxAPI's backend is deployed on **AWS EC2** for reliable hosting, leveraging Amazon’s scalable infrastructure. For enhanced security and performance, **Cloudflare** is used for frontend deployment.

- **Image Handling**: For handling image uploads, **Appwrite** was integrated into the project. Appwrite provides a straightforward and developer-friendly platform to store and manage media, ensuring images are securely uploaded and accessed when needed.

Together, this tech stack powers NyxAPI’s seamless mock API generation, helping development teams stay productive and collaborate effectively.

### Usage of Appwrite

NyxAPI utilizes **Appwrite** for efficient image storage and management, allowing seamless uploading, storing, and serving of user-uploaded images while ensuring secure access and smooth user experience. In the future, we plan to implement **One-Time Password (OTP) authentication** with Appwrite, adding an extra layer of security during user login. This integration will help safeguard sensitive information and ensure that only authorized users can access their accounts.
