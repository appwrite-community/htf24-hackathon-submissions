## Project Title
Trustify- Protect Yourself from Fake and Malicious QR Codes

## Project Description    
-Trustify QR is an AI-powered security tool designed to keep you safe from malicious QR codes. Using advanced machine learning, AppGuard QR scans and analyzes QR codes in real-time to identify potential risks, such as hidden malware, phishing links, and unauthorized redirections. Whether you're scanning QR codes for payments, promotions, or websites, AppGuard QR ensures your safety at every step.

## Inspiration behind the Project  

-The inspiration for Trustify came from witnessing how quickly QR codes have become part of daily life‚Äîand the security risks that have come along with them. QR codes are everywhere now, from restaurants and stores to payments and promotions. But this convenience has also made them a target for scammers, who embed fake or malicious links that can steal personal information or even compromise devices with malware.

Seeing people unknowingly fall victim to these scams sparked an idea: what if there was a simple, reliable way to check the safety of a QR code before scanning it? Thus, Trustify was created. By harnessing AI‚Äôs power, we aimed to give people the confidence to interact with QR codes securely and without worry.
