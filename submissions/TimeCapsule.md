## Project Title

Time Capsule - Memory Fort

## Project Description

The project I created is **Memory Fort**, a digital time capsule platform that allows users to create, manage, and share memories that can be revealed at specific times in the future. Users can create both private and public time capsules, schedule reveal dates, and attach various types of media to their capsules. The platform features flexible views for browsing memories, advanced filtering options, and a user-friendly dashboard for managing capsules.

## Inspiration behind the Project 

The reason I chose this idea/project was to provide a unique way for individuals to preserve and share their memories. In a world where digital content is often fleeting, I wanted to create a platform that allows users to curate their experiences and share them with others at meaningful moments in the future.
