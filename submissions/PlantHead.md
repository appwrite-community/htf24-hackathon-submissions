## Project Title
**PlantHead - Your Social Plant Paradise**

## Project Description
PlantHead is a vibrant community platform where plant enthusiasts can share their green journeys and inspire others. Similar to Snapchat's streak feature, users can maintain their "plant streaks" by regularly sharing updates about their botanical companions. The app sends smart notifications for watering schedules based on each plant's specific needs. With location-based posts, users can discover what's growing in their neighborhood and connect with local plant parents. Whether you're a seasoned gardener or just starting your plant journey to plant mom, PlantHead helps you nurture your green family while being part of a thriving community.

## Inspiration behind the Project
I was inspired by my mom who once spotted a plant and told me about its medicinal properties for treating bruises. I realized I don't really know much about the plants growing in my neighborhood! Also, since I have different plants in my garden and balcony, I often forget whether I've watered them or not. These simple problems got me thinking - why not create something that could help solve these everyday plant parent struggles?

## Tech Stack    
The project is built using:
- Vite React for crafting smooth, responsive user interfaces
- Tailwind CSS for elegant, modern styling
- Appwrite as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) powering authentication, database management, and notification systems

### Usage of Appwrite
- Appwrite Authentication: Implements secure user authentication, handling sign-ups, log-ins, and session management using JWT
- Appwrite Databases: Manages structured storage for post information and user plant data
- Appwrite Storage: Handles secure storage and retrieval of plant images and user-generated content

## Anything Else You Want To Share With Us?
Working with Appwrite was mostly great - loved the quick setup and real-time database features! Though there were some learning curves with queries, overall it proved to be the perfect choice for PlantHead. Looking forward to building more features with it!
