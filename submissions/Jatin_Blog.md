## Project Title
Jatin_Blog : Creative Blogs

## Project Description    
-Jatin_blog is a responsive blogging platform where users can create, manage, and comment on posts. Built using React for the frontend, Node.js with MongoDB for the backend, and Appwrite for backend services, it features JWT-based authentication, post categorization, and a search function for easy navigation.

## Inspiration behind the Project  

-The inspiration behind Jatin_blog came from the need for a streamlined, user-friendly platform where people can express their thoughts without the clutter of many modern blogging sites. I wanted to build something that focused on simplicity, functionality, and secure interaction‚Äîallowing users to easily write and categorize posts while also engaging with others through comments.

-The use of Appwrite and technologies like React, Node.js, and MongoDB stemmed from my desire to explore modern web development tools that can create scalable, full-stack applications. This project served as a way to challenge myself, expand my development skills, and deliver a practical solution for online content creation and management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack    
Frontend: React
Backend: Node.js, Express
