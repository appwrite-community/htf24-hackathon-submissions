## Project Title
Weebhook

## Project Description    
During this hackathon, I developed a project that captures and inspects webhook requests, providing a streamlined way to analyze payload data.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The motivation for building this project stems from the widespread use of webhooks by services like Discord, Stripe, and Appwrite to transmit data. Often, their documentation is limited or unclear, making it challenging to interpret payloads accurately. This tool addresses that gap by allowing users to inspect actual webhook payloads directly, simplifying the process of understanding and integrating these services.

## Tech Stack    
In this project, I utilized, NextJS, Tailwind, and Appwrite.
