## Project Title
Entrepreneurs' Hub


## Inspiration behind the Project
I am currently studying a course called basic entrepreneurship, where students are required to form teams of five people and come up with a unique creative venture which solves a preoblem in the community. Our lecturer for this course has always struggled with trying to remember ventures that have been done before by prior students, in order to show off their problem solving skills and also motivate our creativity. Some times she can't really remember how a particular venture was made, or who made it. She believes that all knowledge should be shared, because it could be beneficial when others go with it back home or to their different communities. In this month of celebrating open source, i also believe that knowlede should be open sourced, so that people all over the world can access it and make any modifications to use it to improve their communities. That is why I cmae up up with this unique venture, that is a web application, so that the knowledge can be transfered from place to place, and across all generations.

## Project Description
Entrepreneurs' Hub is a platform for students to upload their business ventures, images, share their knowledge, how they came up with those ventures, View other people's ventures and react on them
