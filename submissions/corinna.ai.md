**Corinna AI - MultiChatbot**

## Project Description    
Corinna is a comprehensive AI-powered chatbot solution designed for SaaS platforms to enhance customer engagement, streamline communication, and optimize email marketing. Built with a modern tech stack, this chatbot integrates advanced features such as user authentication, real-time communication, file uploads, and secure payment processing, providing a seamless experience for SaaS users. The platform empowers businesses to interact with customers efficiently while managing personalized email marketing campaigns through a robust, customizable interface.

We aimed to combine essential SaaS functionalities with powerful AI-driven communication to create an easy-to-integrate solution that streamlines user engagement.
