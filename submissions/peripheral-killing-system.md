## Project Title
**Peripheral Killing System**

## Project Description    
Peripheral Killing System is a hands-free control system that uses hand gestures to manage essential computer functions like volume, brightness, and mouse movements. Built using Python with OpenCV and MediaPipe, the project allows users to operate their computer through intuitive gesturesâ€”eliminating the need for a physical keyboard or mouse. This system is especially beneficial for accessibility, enhancing usability for those with limited mobility.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The idea for Peripheral Killing System originated from the need to create a more accessible, intuitive way to control computers. Traditional peripherals can sometimes be restrictive, so I wanted to explore gesture-based interactions as a way to provide a hands-free solution. Leveraging OpenCV and MediaPipe, this project challenged me to build a practical, responsive system that could interpret hand gestures in real-time.

## Key Features:

- **Volume Control**: Adjust volume with a zoom-in (thumb and little finger together) or zoom-out gesture (thumb and little finger apart).
- **Brightness Control**: Increase or decrease screen brightness with zoom gestures similar to volume control.
- **Mouse Control**: Move the cursor by pointing with the index finger; perform left-clicks by joining the thumb and index finger.
- **Air Keyboard**: Use specific hand gestures to simulate keyboard inputs, making it easy to interact without physical contact.

## Tech Stack    
The project is built using:

- **Client**: Python with Tkinter
- **Computer Vision & Gesture Recognition**: OpenCV, MediaPipe

### Usage of Appwrite
- **Appwrite Authentication**: I used Appwrite Auth to manage user authentication, including sign-ups, log-ins, google signin and maintaining user sessions.
- **Appwrite Databases**: I used Appwrite databases to store user accounts, manage code descriptions, and save the algorithms written in multiple languages.
- **Appwrite Storage**: Appwrite storage is used for securely storing user profile pictures.

## Anything Else You Want To Share With Us?
Peripheral Killing System highlights the potential of computer vision in enhancing accessibility and usability. By integrating OpenCV and MediaPipe, this project not only serves as an effective hands-free control system but also as an exciting exploration of AI and computer vision. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of gesture recognition, computer vision, and Python, pushing the boundaries of user-computer interaction.
