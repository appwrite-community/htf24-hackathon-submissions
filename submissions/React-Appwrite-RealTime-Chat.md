## Project Title  
**Real-Time Chat App**

## Project Description    
During the hackathon, we built a **Real-Time Chat Application** using **React JS** and **Appwrite**. The app allows users to register, log in, and chat in real-time. It features an intuitive interface for easy communication, with messages updating instantly across all active users. The backend infrastructure is powered by **Appwrite**, handling authentication, database management, and real-time functionality.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The motivation behind this project was to create a fast and reliable communication platform. Real-time communication has become essential in todayâ€™s digital world, and we wanted to explore the power of Appwrite to build an efficient chat app. This project was driven by the desire to simplify real-time messaging, making it more accessible and scalable.

## Tech Stack    
- **React JS**: Used for building the frontend UI.
- **Appwrite**: A complete backend platform that managed user authentication, real-time messaging, and database operations.
- **Appwrite Real-Time API**: Implemented for real-time message synchronization.
- **Appwrite Databases**: For storing user details and chat messages.
- **Appwrite Authentication**: To manage user sessions, registration, and login functionality.

### Usage of Appwrite
- **Appwrite Authentication**:  
  Implemented for handling user sign-ups, logins, and session management securely.
  
- **Appwrite Databases**:  
  Used to create and store chat messages in the `messages` collection, including attributes such as `user_id`, `username`, and `message body`.

- **Appwrite Real-Time API**:  
  Utilized to ensure that messages are updated in real time across all connected users as soon as a new message is added to the database.
