## Project Title
KitchenPal

## Project Description    
KitchenPal is a recipe management app that helps users save, organize, and generate recipes based on their dietary preferences. It integrates Appwrite for authentication and database management, along with the Gemini Generate API for AI-generated recipes. Additionally, the app supports multiple themes, enabling users to personalize their interface.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
KitchenPal came from the simple, everyday challenge of figuring out what to cook, especially when trying to stick to dietary preferences or use up ingredients you already have. We wanted to build something that takes the stress out of meal planning by letting you save favorite recipes and easily generate new ones based on what’s in your pantry. It’s a way to make cooking more fun, organized, and personalized, so people can enjoy healthier meals without the hassle.

## Tech Stack    
The technologies I used:
- **Next.js** for the frontend, providing a fast and seamless user experience.
- **Material UI** for a smooth, responsive, and visually appealing interface.
- **Appwrite** as the backend for user authentication, database management, and secure data storage.
- **Google’s Gemini Generate API** for personalized AI-generated recipes.
- **React Context API** to manage theme switching between different color schemes.
- **ESLint** to ensure clean and maintainable code.


### Usage of Appwrite
- **Appwrite Authentication**: Used for managing user sign-ups, logins, and secure access to personal data.
- **Appwrite Database**: Stored user-generated content such as recipes and dietary preferences.
