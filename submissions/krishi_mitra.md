## Project Title  
Krishi Mitra

## Project Description  
Krishi Mitra is a web platform designed to help farmers easily find relevant government schemes based on their input, such as income, crop type, and other factors. This tool aims to simplify access to available benefits, subsidies, and programs, empowering farmers with the resources they need to grow and thrive.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The inspiration behind Krishi Mitra came from the challenges faced by farmers in accessing government schemes due to lack of awareness or complex processes. We chose this idea to bridge the gap between farmers and the benefits provided by the government, ensuring they can take advantage of opportunities that would otherwise be overlooked.

## Tech Stack  
- Next.js for the frontend
- Appwrite for authentication and backend services
- Appwrite for managing databases and backend storage
- Vercel for deployment
### Usage of Appwrite
- **Appwrite Databases**: Used for storing farmer inputs and matching them to relevant schemes.
- **Appwrite Storage**: Used to securely store and retrieve important data.
- **Appwrite Filters**: Used to filter the schemes based on the Input.
