## Project Title
**Algomorph - DSA Algorithm Explorer**

## Project Description    
The project I built during the hackathon is **Algomorph**, a comprehensive platform that allows users to explore, learn, and implement popular Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in multiple programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. The platform provides an interactive playground for running algorithms, dynamic visualizations to make learning easier, and a discussions tab where users can collaborate, upvote, downvote, and comment on algorithmic problems and ideas.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The reason I chose this project was to create a one-stop solution for anyone looking to understand algorithms better, whether they're students preparing for coding interviews or professionals brushing up their DSA knowledge. I wanted to include multiple languages, interactive code editing, and visual learning elements to make the learning process more engaging and intuitive. The discussion feature encourages collaboration, allowing users to discuss ideas and improve together.

## Tech Stack    
The project is built using:

- **Next.js** for the frontend and backend
- **Monaco Editor** for the interactive code playground
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling the application
- **Appwrite** for backend services like authentication and file storage
- **Prisma** and **PostgreSQL (NeonDB)** for managing and storing data related to the discussions tab, including comments, upvotes, and downvotes
- **React** for building dynamic user interfaces

### Usage of Appwrite
- **Appwrite Authentication**: I used Appwrite Auth to manage user authentication, including sign-ups, log-ins, google signin and maintaining user sessions.
- **Appwrite Databases**: I used Appwrite databases to store user accounts, manage code descriptions, and save the algorithms written in multiple languages.
- **Appwrite Storage**: Appwrite storage is used for securely storing user profile pictures.

## Anything Else You Want To Share With Us?
Algomorph is designed not only for individual learners but also as a collaborative platform, making it a unique place for people to discuss, vote on, and improve their algorithmic understanding. The discussion feature allows users to exchange ideas, making this project more community-focused and a helpful resource for coding interview preparation and beyond.
