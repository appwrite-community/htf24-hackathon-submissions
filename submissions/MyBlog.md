## My Blog
* Developed a feature-rich blogging platform with secure user authentication and role-based
permissions, incorporating a rich text editor (TinyMCE) for content creation.
* This blogging platform uses Appwrite for secure user authentication, blog data storage, and role-based permissions. Appwrite’s Authentication manages secure login, while its Database stores and retrieves user-generated content.

## Inspiration behind the Project

* I was joining Appwrite hackathon, but without friends to form a team or any clear project ideas, I decided to seek inspiration online. As I explored various articles on Medium, I had a lightbulb moment: why not create something medium type of blog system

## Tech Stack
React, Tailwind CSS, Appwrite, and ReduxToolkit
