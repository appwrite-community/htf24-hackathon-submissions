## Inspiration behind the Project  
I've always been a news junkie. I love staying informed about the world around me, but it can be overwhelming to keep up with all the different sources and topics. That's why I decided to create this project, a personalized  platform designed to make it easy for people like me to stay informed.


Building app was a challenging but rewarding experience. I learned a lot about web development, user experience, and the importance of building a strong community. I'm proud of what I've accomplished, and I'm excited to see where News-Web will go in the future.

I hope that app will continue to be a valuable resource for people who want to stay informed and connected.
