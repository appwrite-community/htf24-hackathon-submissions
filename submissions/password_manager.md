## Project Title
**Password Manager**

## Project Description    
I am developing an app that securely stores and manages passwords.

### Features of the App
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly find previously saved passwords.
- **Password Details:** View associated details such as email, password, description, hint, and connected social accounts.
- **Add New Passwords:** Easily input new password information.
- **Password List:** View a comprehensive list of saved passwords and associated emails.
- **Social Media Integration:** Add and manage social media accounts.
- **Password Generation:** Generate strong passwords for new accounts directly within the app.

## Inspiration Behind the Project  
As a news enthusiast, I often find it challenging to keep track of all my accounts across various platforms. This inspired me to create a personalized password management tool that helps users remember and secure their passwords efficiently. My experience in web development and user experience design has been instrumental in shaping this project, and Iâ€™m excited to see how it evolves to meet the needs of users.

## Tech Stack    
- **React:** For building the frontend interface.
- **Next.js:** For server-side rendering and API management.
- **TypeScript:** To ensure type safety and enhance the developer experience.
- **Appwrite:** As the backend service for secure data management, including databases and authentication.

### Usage of Appwrite

- **Appwrite Authentication:** Manages user authentication and session handling securely, allowing users to log in with options like email/password, SMS, or OAuth providers such as Google and GitHub.

- **Appwrite SDK:** Facilitates secure communication with the Appwrite API, ensuring efficient user authentication and session management.

- **Appwrite Databases:** Creates and stores login information in a `manager` collection, securely managing user data such as passwords and transaction history.

- **Appwrite Storage:** Manages file uploads, allowing users to securely store and share project-related documents and images.

- **Appwrite Real-Time API:** Ensures instant updates across all connected users whenever new data is added to the database, enhancing collaboration.

- **Appwrite Functions:** Enables serverless backend operations, ensuring scalability and security.

- **Appwrite Notifications:** Facilitates sending and scheduling of email, SMS, and push notifications.

- **Appwrite Users:** Allows management of project users, including searching, blocking, and editing preferences.
